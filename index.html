                        Valorant is a 5v5 tactical FPS
                        where in addition to precise gunplay 
                        charaters have uniqe abilities.
                        This work is part of my Digi Intro course
                        at Haaga-Helia UAS.

                    Reyna takes what she wants when she wants it,
                    no matter who is standing in her way. 
                    Savage and almost animalistic, she is not one to hesitate when it comes
                    to eliminating her enemies and getting blood on her hands.

                    With a blend of suave nonchalance, professional poise,
                    and smug comedy, Chamber is fully confident 
                    with the skill he provides and the value that he offers. 
                    He sets high standards for himself and his team, reminding everyone
                    to be the best in what they do.

                    A living nightmare, Omen takes will not hesitate to eliminate his enemies
                    using the forces of paranoia and fear. 
                    He is cynical in nature, which stems from him experiencing
                    extreme pain as he was condemned to remain in the state that he is today.

                    Hailing from Australia, Skye and her band of beasts trail-blaze the way through 
                    hostile territory. With her creations hampering the enemy, and her power to heal 
                    others, the team is strongest and safest by Skye's side.

                    Raze explodes out of Brazil with her big personality and big guns. 
                    With her blunt-force-trauma playstyle, she excels at flushing entrenched 
                    enemies and clearing tight spaces with a generous dose of “boom.”
